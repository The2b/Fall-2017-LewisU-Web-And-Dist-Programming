JavaScript and HTML Interaction
Requirements

For this assignment you will need to:

    Create an HTML page with the following elements:
        Image with a fixed width and height (e.g. 400 x 300) with id="theImage"
        Form with a textbox with id="imageURL" (labeled "Source URL"), and two plain buttons: one with value="Add image" and id="addButton", and another with value="Next image" and id="nextImageButton"
    Add an event handler for the onload event that:
        Creates an empty array called imageArray
        Creates a variable called currentImage and initializes it to 0
        NOTE: Define the variables implicitly (do not use var) so they can be accessible in other functions.
    Add an event handler for the click event on the addButton. It should take the text that is in the imageURL textbox, check if it forms a valid URL for an image (just check if it begins in http and ends in jpg or gif), and append it to the imageArray. If it's not valid, display an appropriate alert.
    Add an event handler for the click event on the nextImageButton. Have it set the src property of theImage to the next image URL in the imageArray, that is, the image at index currentImage. Cycle if currentImage goes over bounds of array.

Additional Requirements

The following items should be part of nearly every assignment. It is best to get in the practice.

    Verify that your page should display correctly when using the Google Chrome browser
    Validate your HTML5 file using the W3C validator service
    Utilize proper programming style including the use of whitespace (line breaks and indents) to separate sections of your code
    Include comment at the top of your HTML file containing your name, course name, semester, and "Week X Lab" where "X" is the current week
